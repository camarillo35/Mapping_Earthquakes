# Mapping_Earthquakes

Stakeholders would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.


In this project, Leaflet.js library, Javascript, and HTML were used to create interactive maps. The maps allow users to visually see earthquake and tectonic plate information which was originally stored in a GeoJSON file.

Tasks completed

  Creating popup information boxes on location
  Toggle to enable the use to switch between earthquakes and tectonic information as well as to switch between map styles (streets, satellite and dark)
  Color changes to lines
  Color changes on marker types according to radius and earthquake magnitude
  Plotting lines, points and polygons
